The Schools I chose to help me along with my career as a game programmer 
(or sofware engineer) are the University of Waterloo, University of 
Toronto, and Seneca College. I chose the University of Waterloo because it
is one of the best universities for a computer science degree in Canada.
My second choice is UofT because it's easy to get into, close by, and
is pretty good for computer science. I chose Seneca College for my third
choice because I live really close to it, and we had to include at least 1 
college on our list of schools.
